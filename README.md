# Collaborative fCM Modelling

This repository contains materials and the collected raw questionnaire data from the context of my master's thesis about collaborative fCM modelling.
Thereby, it is structured as follows:

* The directory *collaborative_modelling_framework* contains all materials to recreate the proposed collaborative modelling framework.
* The directory *modelling_session_materials* contains the materials required to conduct collaborative modelling sessions, which follow the concept of a role-playing experiment. Here, you also find the role-based process descriptions for the M\&A as well as the change management process.
* The directory *participant_preparation* comprises the study consent form as well as the initial textual training on fCM.
* The directory *questionnaires* contain the employed questionnaires for assessing the fCM skill levels of the acquired study participants, as well as for surveying how they experience a modelling session. Finally, the directory *results* provide CSV files of the collected questionnaire data.

Due to data privacy concerns, the recordings of the modelling sessions are deleted after the defense of my master's thesis and not part of any publication. Instead, the master's thesis provides holistic and prosaic descriptions of what happened during the sessions.
